- Creating and Converting Leads
     - What's a Lead? Leads are people who are interested in your product and service. But they are not your customers yet.
     - You can add rules for leads. Ex: a new lead/user? => has a specific criteria? => do something
     - Create list views for leads
     - Leads vs Account vs Contacts vs Opportunity? Leads end up being a part of the three of those or non of them.
     - Leads are a holding area of prospective customers. If they are qualified then convert them because they are qualified
       If they are not qualified then they won't make it passed a lead.
     - The business determines the minimum criteria to consider a lead qualified
